# Project Name Convention

As you embark on your internship with our Python projects, it's important to familiarize yourself with some key naming conventions. These conventions are not just arbitrary rules; they help keep our code clean, organized, and easy to read. Here's a quick guide to help you adhere to these best practices:

1. **Packages**: Name your packages in all lowercase letters. If needed, use underscores to improve readability, but aim for short, simple names (e.g., `data_processor`).
2. **Scripts**: Like packages, script names should also be all lowercase. Use underscores to separate words. The name should reflect the script's functionality (e.g., `manage_inventory.py`).
3. **Classes**: Classes should follow the CapWords convention, where each word in the class name starts with a capital letter without underscores (e.g., `InventoryManager`). This is also known as CamelCase.
4. **Functions**: Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores for readability. Choose descriptive names that clearly indicate what the function does (e.g., `calculate_total`).
5. **Variables**: Use lowercase letters and underscores for variables (e.g., `item_list`). This makes them easily distinguishable from class names.
6. **Constants**: Define constants in all capital letters, with underscores separating words. These are typically set at the module level (e.g., `MAX_LIMIT`).
7. **Overall Project Name**: Choose an overall project name with a Cap-Word style, where each word starts with an uppercase letter and is connected with a hyphen.

These guidelines are aligned with PEP 8, Python's official style guide, and help maintain a standard across the Python community. By following these conventions, you'll not only make your code more accessible to others but also ensure a cohesive and professional codebase within our project.
